# Race JE

Welcome to our game, it made with Bullet Physics.

###Objective

Our goal is to make a map, where you drive a car and you have to overcome a number of obstacles.

###Release 0.1
In this release we implemented 3 functions:
	- PhysBody3D* CreateStraight(), This function creates a straight road.
	- void CreateUPER(), This function creates a uphill road. ("need some adjustments.")
	- void CreateCurve(), This function creates a curve.

	In order to see what each function does, we have created a mini map with each function.
